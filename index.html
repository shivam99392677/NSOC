        <div>
          <h3>Elegance</h3>
          <h4>Refined Aesthetics</h4>
          <p>
            Minimalist elements and careful alignment create a sense of luxury
            and professionalism. Every detail is intentional, from the use of
            space to the choice of color accents.
          </p>
          <h4>Contrast and Focus</h4>
          <p>
            Strong contrasts guide the user’s attention, making key content
            stand out and enhancing readability. We use shadows, overlays, and
            gradients to add richness and dimension.
          </p>
          <p>
            Elegance means restraint—knowing when to let content breathe and
            when to make a statement.

          <h3>Depth</h3>
          <h4>Layered Design</h4>
          <p>
            The Dark Side leverages depth through visual hierarchy, subtle
            animations, and interactive cues. Our interfaces feel immersive,
            drawing users into the experience.
          </p>
          <h4>Dynamic Interactions</h4>
          <p>
            Interactive elements and transitions create a sense of movement and
            intrigue, encouraging users to explore further. We use parallax,
            overlays, and modal windows to add complexity and engagement.
          </p>
          <p>
            Depth is not just visual—it’s about creating a journey that unfolds
            as users interact with the site.
